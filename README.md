### OpenCV Setup
1. Download Prebuilt OpenCv from [This Link](https://opencv.org/releases/) and extract for example in [cvdir]
2. Download Visual Studio Community from [This Link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
3. Clone this Repo and open /cpp/eyetracking/eyetracking.sln
4. Right-click on project &rarr; Properties
